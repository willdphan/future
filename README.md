# FUTURE

This project is an AI-powered application that generates outcomes based on user input. It uses the Groq API for natural language processing and is built with FastAPI and Modal for deployment.

## Project Structure

```
├── README.md
├── src/
│ └── app/
│ └── api/
│ └── groq.py
├── requirements.txt (assumed)
└── .env (assumed)
```

## File Descriptions

1. `README.md`: This file, containing information about the project, its structure, and how to set it up and use it.

2. `src/app/api/groq.py`: The main application file containing:

   - Configuration for the Groq API client
   - The `generate_outcomes` function that processes user input and generates outcomes
   - FastAPI app setup with CORS middleware
   - Endpoint definition for the `/generate-outcomes` route

3. `requirements.txt` (assumed): Lists all Python dependencies required for the project.

4. `.env` (assumed): Contains environment variables such as API keys and other configuration settings.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-name>
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Groq API key:
   ```
   GROQ_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Running the Application

To run the application locally for development:

`modal serve src/app/api/groq.py`

This will start the FastAPI server using Modal, making it accessible at `http://localhost:8000` by default.

## API Usage

The application exposes a single endpoint:

- `POST /generate-outcomes`
  - Accepts JSON payload with a `prompt` field
  - Returns generated outcomes based on the input prompt

Example request:

```
json
{
"prompt": "What are potential outcomes of climate change?"
}
```

## Deployment

This application is designed to be deployed using Modal. Refer to Modal's documentation for detailed deployment instructions.
